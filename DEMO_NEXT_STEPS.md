# CINTA demo and next steps

## Working addresses

- Public demo: [https://hack-growth.dev/](https://hack-growth.dev/)
- Public health: [https://hack-growth.dev/health](https://hack-growth.dev/health)
- Public state: [https://hack-growth.dev/state](https://hack-growth.dev/state)
- Local demo: [http://127.0.0.1:8899/](http://127.0.0.1:8899/), when the canonical local service runs
- Replacement draft: [jamipuchi/hackspain PR #7](https://github.com/jamipuchi/hackspain/pull/7)

The public URL serves the last working release. Generated-item creation and Reset defaults are not deployed there.

## Current public demo

1. Open the public page and wait for the running state.
2. Show **Overview**, **Sorting**, and **Belt**.
3. Switch between **3D** and **2D**.
4. Open **Items** and show the built-in catalog and shared policy.
5. Open **Details** and show source, model, session, policy, browser FPS, and simulation speed.
6. Explain that `Sim 0.119557x` means the engine runs slower than wall time.
7. Drop a test Stone only when a shared-session mutation is acceptable.
8. Compare the expected decision with the retained physical outcome.

One verified public Stone spilled. Do not promise that a Reject decision always reaches the Reject bin.

Browser FPS measures rendering. The **Sim** badge measures simulated seconds per wall second.

## Replacement candidate for judges

The candidate accepts an item description and can call the real provider after explicit operator approval.

It renders the item, validates its asset, estimates physics, retrains the classifier, and prepares an immutable activation bundle.

Hard failures block activation. These include invalid assets, failed training, insufficient coverage, and new-label recall below 90%.

Physical Keep, anomaly, and overall accuracy failures appear as **Needs review** warnings. Judges should see these warnings as measured limitations.

The complete real-provider flow, activation, reset, and public deployment still need final E2E verification.

## Reset defaults

Run a safe preview from the repository checkout:

```bash
./deploy/hack-growth.dev/reset-live-state.sh --dry-run
```

Apply the reset from the laptop only after the dry run succeeds:

```bash
./deploy/hack-growth.dev/reset-live-state.sh --apply
```

The script targets only the `coffee` service on SSH host `hackspain`.

Reset defaults restores the built-in catalog and model. It preserves Wall of Fame history, generated assets, failed submissions, and verified previews.

The integrated button and laptop flow still need final deployment E2E proof.

## Verify before presenting

Run these checks shortly before the public demo:

```bash
curl --fail --show-error https://hack-growth.dev/health
curl --fail --show-error https://hack-growth.dev/state
curl --fail --show-error https://hack-growth.dev/live.js >/dev/null
curl --fail --show-error https://hack-growth.dev/timeline.mjs >/dev/null
```

Confirm that `/state` reports source `30758f7dd499027ffe76a8f7646377c0f94fa596` until the replacement deploys.

Use agent-browser for final browser evidence:

```bash
agent-browser skills get core
agent-browser open https://hack-growth.dev/
agent-browser snapshot
```

Confirm HTTPS, WSS, advancing simulation time, stable reconnect, shared sessions, Items, warnings, generated assets, mobile layout, and Reset defaults.

## Release path

1. Freeze the reviewed combined source and final bundled model.
2. Run one real generated-item flow with an explicit provider grant.
3. Verify hard failures, warnings, activation, restart, and recovery.
4. Run Reset defaults and verify preserved Wall of Fame evidence.
5. Capture desktop and mobile browser evidence.
6. Build the immutable image and verify all identities.
7. Deploy, then verify private health, public HTTPS, public WSS, recovery, and reset.
